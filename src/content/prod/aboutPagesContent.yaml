     - paragraph: "The CTDC is part of the $$[Cancer Research Data Commons](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/)$$ (CRDC), an initiative from NCI’s Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (CBIIT). The goals of the CTDC are to advance cancer research and accelerate the development of innovative therapies by improving access to data from NCI-sponsored clinical studies, including genomic panel assay and clinical data. The CTDC does this through:  "
     - paragraph: "$$%space%$$"
     - paragraph: "$$*Graphical User Interface (GUI)*$$ - The CTDC’s GUI includes an Explore dashboard with search filters to help users visualize, explore, and navigate complex metadata without the need for coding or specialized technical skills." 
     - paragraph: "$$%space%$$"
     - paragraph: "$$*Data consolidation*$$ - The CTDC consolidates data from clinical studies funded by the NCI. This allows researchers to analyze data collectively, leading to deeper insights and a better understanding of cancer’s complexities. "
     - paragraph: "$$%space%$$"
     - paragraph: "$$*Data harmonization*$$ - Data harmonization ensures that data across studies within the CTDC are standardized and organized in a consistent manner to improve data compatibility, integration, and meta-analysis. "
     - paragraph: "$$%space%$$"
     - paragraph: "$$*Integration with NCI Cloud Resources*$$ - Users can easily transfer selected CTDC data to the $$[Velsera Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/analytical-resource/seven-bridges-cancer-genomics-cloud)$$ (SB-CGC), a cloud-based platform for cancer research funded by the NCI.

Unlike traditional REST APIs, which typically require multiple endpoints to retrieve various pieces of data, GraphQL allows clients (the systems making the queries) to fetch exactly what they need in a single request. The Clinical and Translational Data Commons (CTDC) leverages this technology by offering a GraphQL API interface, which enables users to interact with CTDC data directly from their own systems, such as through Jupyter notebooks."
