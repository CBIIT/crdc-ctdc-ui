    - paragraph: "Users can query the CTDC data via Graphical User Interface (GUI) or Application User Interface (GUI). The CTDC GITHUB repo is also available for those interested in accessing our codebase and documentation."
    - paragraph: "$$#CTDC GUI#$$"
    - paragraph: "The GUI provides users a distilled set of parameters (faceted querying) they can use to explore a subset of the CTDC data model. "
    - paragraph: "$$#CTDC API#$$"
    - paragraph: "CTDC is based on a Graph database, featuring a  $$[ GraphQL API](type:internal url:/#/graphql target:_blank)$$  (Java) and a React front-end (JavaScript). Each tier in the application stack is designed to be modular and adaptable for a variety of use-cases and scenarios. A GraphQL API enables querying of the entire data model. The API is provided “as is:” there are no warranties or conditions arising out of usage of these services."
    - paragraph: "$$#GITHUB#$$"
    - paragraph: "The  $$[ CTDC GitHub repo](https://github.com/CBIIT/crdc-ctdc-ui)$$ is available for research, usage, forking, and pull requests. The codebase is intended for sharing and building frameworks for related initiatives and projects. The CTDC GitHub repo has documentation about how to access the system, including endpoints and recommendations for tools and example queries. Both the project and documentation are maintained and updated in accordance with major and minor releases"

  content:
     - paragraph: "The goals of the CTDC are to advance cancer research and accelerate the development of innovative therapies by improving access to data from NCI-sponsored clinical studies, including genomic panel assay and clinical data. The CTDC does this through:  "
     - paragraph: "$$*Graphical User Interface (GUI)*$$ – The CTDC’s GUI includes an Explore dashboard with search filters to help users visualize, explore, and navigate complex metadata without the need for coding or specialized technical skills. "
     - paragraph: "$$*Data consolidation:*$$ The CTDC consolidates data from clinical studies funded by the NCI. This allows researchers to analyze data collectively, leading to deeper insights and a better understanding of cancer’s complexities. "
     - paragraph: "$$*Data harmonization:*$$ Data harmonization ensures that data across studies within the CTDC are standardized and organized in a consistent manner to improve data compatibility, integration, and meta-analysis. "
     - paragraph: "$$*Integration with NCI Cloud Resources:*$$ Users can easily transfer selected CTDC data to the $$[ Velsera Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud (SB-CGC)](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/analytical-resource/seven-bridges-cancer-genomics-cloud)$$, a cloud-based platform for cancer research funded by the NCI. Here, researchers can integrate mutli-omic data across sources and leverage access to a multitude of tools and workflows for computation and analysis.  "
     - paragraph: "$$*Fueling collaborative research:*$$ By centralizing data and making them available through NCI’s Cloud Resources, the CTDC promotes secure collaboration among distributed research groups, fostering interdisciplinary partnerships. "
     - paragraph: "$$*Democratizing Data access:*$$ Data in the CTDC are made available through various access restrictions including open (no registration required) and controlled access (registration required). The CTDC aims to make each dataset as open as possible while protecting participant privacy and adhering to regulations, agreements, and other considerations specific to each study. "
     - paragraph: "$$*Alignment to F.A.I.R data principles:*$$ The CTDC adheres to Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ($$[FAIR]( https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)$$) principles for scientific data management and stewardship. CTDC seeks to provide clearly organized data and guidance enabling end users to search for, find, and access data of interest. The emphasis on harmonization described above promotes the interoperability of data within and across the CRDC ecosystem and beyond and promotes reusability of data beyond the primary publication."
